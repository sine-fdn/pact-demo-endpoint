# specs/rest-api

Here we are distributing OpenAPI files which describe the Use Case 001 REST API.   

**⚠️⚠️ Right now, the OpenAPI files here are work in progress and pending a through review from the Pathfinder community. ⚠️⚠️**

## OpenAPI file lineage

You can regenerate the files by building and running the [endpoint](../../endpoint) to access the [OpenAPI file resource](../../endpoint/README.md#endpoints).
